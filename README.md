# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis
The purpose of this project is to analyze data for a School District, such as student funding and student standardized test scores, to provide insight on performance trends that may inform discussion at the District level. Additionally, to uphold state-testing standards, a second analysis was conducted due to evidence of academic dishonesty at a specific high school.

## Software
Python 3.8, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook

## Results
Due to evidence of academic dishonesty by ninth graders at Thomas High School, the school district analysis was conducted twice.  The frist analysis utilized the entire data that was provided, while the second analysis omitted ninth grade students' math and reading scores from Thomas High School.  Ninth graders from Thomas High School had their scores replaced with NaN.
